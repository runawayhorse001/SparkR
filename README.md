# Learning Apache Spark with R

Website: https://runawayhorse001.github.io/SparkR/


This is a shared repository for Learning Apache Spark with R Notes. The first version was posted on Github in [Feng2017]. This shared repository mainly contains the self-learning and self-teaching notes from Wenqiang during his IMA Data Science Fellowship.

In this repository, I try to use the detailed demo code and examples to show how to use each main functions. If you find your work wasnâ€™t cited in this note, please feel free to let me know.

Although I am by no means an data mining programming and Big Data expert, I decided that it would be useful for me to share what I learned about PySpark programming in the form of easy tutorials with detailed example. I hope those tutorials will be a valuable tool for your studies.

The tutorials assume that the reader has a preliminary knowledge of programing and Linux. And this document is generated automatically by using sphinx.
